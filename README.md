The Hospital Management System is centered around managing the assignments of nurses to patients and keeping track of patient information. 
Functionality:
Patient Management:

Add New Patients: Enter new patient details into the system, including name, age, gender, disease, and the nurse assigned to them.
Search for Patients: Allows users to search for existing patients by name or other attributes to view their details.
Nurse Management:

Assign Nurses to Patients: Assign or reassign nurses to patients, managing who is responsible for the care of each patient.
Search for Nurses: Search for nurses in the system to view their details, including their experience and the patients currently assigned to them.
Database Integration:

The system integrates with an SQLite database, ensuring that all patient and nurse data is stored and retrieved efficiently.
Problems Solved:
Centralized Patient Information:

The system provides a centralized database for storing and retrieving patient information. This is crucial for hospitals or clinics where patient data needs to be accessed quickly and reliably.
Efficient Nurse Assignment:

Manually assigning nurses to patients can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This system streamlines the process, allowing for easy assignments and updates, which is especially useful in dynamic environments where patient needs and staff availability may frequently change.
Quick Access to Information:

In a healthcare setting, quick access to patient and staff information is vital. This system allows staff to quickly search for patient or nurse details, improving response times and potentially the quality of care.
Scalability and Data Integrity:

Using a structured database like SQLite ensures data integrity and scalability. As the number of patients and nurses grows, the system remains reliable and efficient.
Flexibility in Patient-Nurse Management:

The system provides flexibility in managing nurse assignments, accommodating changes in staff availability, patient intake, and care requirements.
Additional Considerations:
Privacy and Security: Patient data is sensitive. Implementing robust security measures to protect this data is crucial.
Expandability: The system can be expanded to include more features, such as scheduling, treatment tracking, or integration with other hospital management systems.
User Interface: A user-friendly interface is essential for ensuring that the system is accessible to all staff, regardless of their technical expertise.
This Hospital Management System thus offers a practical solution to efficiently manage patient and nurse data, enhancing the operational efficiency of a healthcare facility.
